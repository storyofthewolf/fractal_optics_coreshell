 scattering by fractal aggregates of identical spheres."

Original code from P. Rannou and R. Botet.
Translated to F90 by E.T. Wolf

2014.07.01.  Wolf, E.T.  Added option to treat monomer particle with a mie coreshell calculation


::::: Basic  Instructions :::::

To build
% make

To run
% fractaloptics.exe


:::::: Input File ::::::::
All model input is put in a text file named "INPUT" 
See examples in IOFILES directory


Format  of INPUT
line 1:       (I5, L7),  N, do_miess
line 2:       (A75), header
line 3 to N:  (f10.4,      f10.5, f10.5, f12.1,    f5.2,  f5.2,       f10.5,    f5.1, f5.1,  f10.5, f10.5, f10.5)
               wavelength, rfi,   rfr,   nmonomer, alpha, fractaldim, rmonomer, xv,   angle, rcore, rfiSH, rfrSH

Descritpion of entries
N           = number of entries in INPUT file
do_miess    = to do mie coreshell calculation or not to do?
header      = column titles for subsequent data
wavelength  = wavelength in microns 
rfi         = imaginary refractive index (core)
rfr         = real refractive index (core)
nmonomer    = number of monomers in the aggregate
alpha       = fractal prefactor or "packing coefficient"
fractaldim  = fractal dimension
rmonomer    = radius of monomer particle in microns
xv          = set to one
angle       = set to zero 
rcore       = radius of core, by definition the shell thickness is then rmonomer-rcore, only used if do_miess=T
rfiSH       = imaginary refractive index of shell, only used if do_miess=T
rfrSH       = real refractive index of shell, only used if do_miess=T

WVL(um), QEXT, QSCA, SINGSCAT, ASYM

NOTE!! QEXT and QSCA are defined relative to the area of the equivalent spherical particle.
